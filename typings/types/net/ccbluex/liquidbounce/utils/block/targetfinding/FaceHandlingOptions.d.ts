/**
 * Decides how scaffold processes the faces of the considered target blocks.
 *
 * @param facePositionFactory given a face, it will yield a point on the face to target.
 * @param considerFacingAwayFaces decides whether scaffold will consider faces which point away from the player camera as possible targets, as it is mostly nonsensical. The expand-scaffold, for example, needs them to be considered to work.
